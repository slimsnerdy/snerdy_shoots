            Hi, Iâ€™m Andy. Iâ€™m a programmer that shoots all the experiences worth capturing. Whether itâ€™s professional headshots, portraits of family or pets, events like parties, birthdays, showers, or even food, landscapes, or products, I shoot it all. As a nerd by nature, my whole methodology is technical: from capturing the stills to the editing process. This lean framework to my process yields a natural final image that is beautiful, clean, and simple. Perfect for displaying and reliving lifeâ€™s finest moments.
